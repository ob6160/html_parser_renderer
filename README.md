# HTML Parser Renderer

Why hello there.

I'm mainly making this project to learn about the fundamentals of browsers are put together.

Why? Because I enjoy it

This project is **not** supposed to be used for anything real :)

Some goals off the top of my head:

- parse HTML, CSS to an acceptable extent
- render basic html
- apply some fundamental css rules to said html
- stretch goal: render the google homepage (or a stripped down version of it)

I'll be trying to document & test as I go, so feel free to follow along.
