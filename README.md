# HTML Parser Renderer

Why hello there.

I'm using this project mainly to learn about how browsers are put together, from the very fundamentals.

It's not supposed to be used for anything real :)

Some goals off the top of my head:

- parse html, css
- render basic html
- apply some fundamental css rules to said html

I'll be trying to document & test as I go, so feel free to follow along.
